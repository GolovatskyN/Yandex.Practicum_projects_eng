Project 1. Prioritization of hypotheses and analysis of the A/B test for an online store. | Using the data of the online store, prioritize hypotheses, analyze the results of A/B testing and make a decision. | Hypotheses are prioritized by the ICE and RICE frameworks. The analysis of the results of the A/B test is carried out, graphs of cumulative revenue, average check, conversion by groups are created. The statistical significance of differences in conversions and average checks for raw and purified data is calculated. | Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Numpy, SciPy, A/B testing, statistical hypothesis testing. | It was decided to stop the test and record a statistically significant increase in conversion in group B at the significance level of 95%.
Project 2. Metrics and cohort analysis, optimization of Yandex.Afisha marketing costs. | Based on data about visits to the Yandex.Afisha website, study how people use the product, when they start buying, how much money each client brings, when it pays off. | The analysis of data from Yandex.Afisha was carried out in order to optimize marketing costs. The metrics LTV, CAC, Retention rate, DAU, WAU, MAU, ROMI are calculated. | Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Numpy, cohort analysis, product metrics, unit economics. | Based on the metrics, the most promising customer cohorts and traffic sources are identified, which should be emphasized.
Project 3. Hypothesis testing, determination of a promising tariff for a telecom company | Based on the data of the mobile operator's customers, analyze the behavior of customers and determine a promising tariff. | Data preprocessing was performed (errors were corrected, omissions were processed). The behavior of customers when using the operator's services is analyzed, the optimal sets of services for users are determined. Hypotheses about the difference in the revenue of subscribers of different tariffs and the difference in the revenue of subscribers from Moscow and other regions are tested. | Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Numpy, SciPy, statistical hypothesis testing. | A promising tariff has been determined.
