# Project 1. Prioritization of hypotheses and analysis of the A/B test for an online store

I advise you to view the work at this link: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GolovatskyN/Yandex.Practicum_projects/blob/main/Project_1._AB_test_analysis_and_hypothesis_prioritization/Project_1._AB_test_analysis_and_hypothesis_prioritization.ipynb

## Goal: 
Using the data of the online store, prioritize hypotheses, evaluate the results of A/B testing using various methods.
## Description: 
Hypotheses are prioritized by the ICE and RICE frameworks. The analysis of the results of the A/B test is carried out, graphs of cumulative revenue, average receipt, conversion by groups are constructed. The statistical significance of differences in conversions and average receipts for raw and purified data is calculated.
## Result:
It was decided to stop the test and record a statistically significant increase in conversion in group B at the significance level of 95%.
## Technologies:
- Python;
- Pandas;
- Seaborn;
- NumPy;
- SciPy;
- A/B testing;
- Testing of statistical hypotheses.
